# Learning-PYTHON-
Here I will publish some materials about stuff I learn by myself or from the books

Installing PYTHON:
1) Download https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
2) Run the programm 
3) Install Python Extension and close the app
4) download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
5) Launch Visual Code again and in the left bottom choose the interpreter for Python. You will see a few tabs in the middle on the top of the VS Code and there you should see something like Python 3.8.5 (and a path below it). *IF IT SHOWS YOU ONLY ONE OPTION - THAT YOU NEED TO GIVE HIM A PATH TO THE FILE - DO IT, IT SHOULD HELP, OTHERWISE REINSTALL PYTHON*
5) PROFIT !!!
*try this extension out by making a new file with .py in the end (EXAMPLE.py) and printing Hello World: print ("Hello World") run this programm*
#
Installing pip (*SKIP THIS PIECE OF GUIDE IF YOU'VE INSTALLED PYTHON VERSION 3.6>*):
1) https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
2) curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
3) python get-pip.py *type this one in shell*
#
Upgrading pip:
1) MAC\LINUX:   pip install -U pip
2) WINDOWS: python -m pip install -U pip

#
Alternative way to use PYTHON (*This one is not as effective as a previous one, but if u plan to do some simple tasks - this one can work out*):
1) Register\Just use - repl.it

Structure of my code ( and themes ) looks like this :

I write code on the same theme and i make 1 empty line between different sub-themes

But when i start to write code on the other theme i make 2 empty lines , so it looks like this (open the file README to fully see the picture itself)

#Theme 1

#Theme 2
